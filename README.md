# Bitwala Coding Challenge

This is the project for Bitwala's coding challenge - An iOS/Android app listing the recent Bitcoin blocks and transactions.

## Summary

The app has been built using React Native with TypeScript and fetches the necessary data from [Bitquery](https://bitquery.io) using the [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) client.

Due to time limitations, Expo was used to quickly get started with the application, providing a smooth way of running different simulators as well as a project base setup with TypeScript included.
